# Hi, I’m Mustafa 👋  
Backend-focused software developer building scalable systems and AI-powered applications.

## About Me
I’m a software developer primarily focused on backend engineering, system design, and AI-driven products.  
I enjoy building real-world systems, designing clean architectures, and understanding how backend services behave in production.

I previously gained experience with ASP.NET through internships, which helped me build a strong foundation in backend concepts.  
Today, I mainly work with **Node.js, Django, and FastAPI**, focusing on modern backend architectures and AI-integrated services.
